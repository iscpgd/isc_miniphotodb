# isc_miniphotodb
mini photo database with python and sqlite3, let's go! beginner python programming and tried my best to write it as cleanly as i could! This project stores one photo to your account into the database. awesome and simple and light but a lot of concepts covered for a noob like me! let's get it!

1. install python 3 in your computer.
2. save the script in a folder
3. go to the terminal and type this
	py -3 -m venv (name of you venv)
4. your venv will be created
5. activate your venv by doing this
	 (name of your venv)\Scripts\activate
6. if this does not work, run powershell as admin and type
	Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
7. install all requirements by doing the following lines
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	note that this doesnt work for (matplotlib, ta-lib)


HOW TO USE:

1. run the "app.py" in command prompt or IDE
2. follow the prompts!
