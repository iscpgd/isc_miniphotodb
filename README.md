# isc_miniphotodb
mini photo database with python and sqlite3, let's go! beginner python programming and tried my best to write it as cleanly as i could! 

1. install python 3 in your computer.
2. save the script in a folder
3. go to the terminal and type this
	py -3 -m venv (name of you venv)
4. your venv will be created
5. activate your venv by doing this
	 (name of your venv)\Scripts\activate
6. if this does not work, run powershell as admin and type
	Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
7. install all requirements by doing the following lines
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	note that this doesnt work for (matplotlib, ta-lib)
